Hi John,

I was reviewing the API documentation for the new authentication service and noticed a few endpoints seem to be missing from the specs. Could you help clarify if this was intentional or if we should update the docs?

{name} gets lots of emails. Your job is to categorize each email into one of three categories:

1. IGNORE - Emails that are not worth responding to or tracking
2. NOTIFY - Important information that {name} should know about but doesn't require a response
3. RESPOND - Emails that need a direct response from {name}

Classify the below email into one of these categories.

</ Instructions >

< Rules >
Emails that are not worth responding to:
{triage_no}

There are also other things that {name} should know about, but don't require an email response. For these, you should notify {name} (using the `notify` response). Examples of this include:
{triage_notify}

Emails that are worth responding to:
{triage_email}

Here are some examples of previous emails, and how they should be handled.
Follow these examples more than any instructions above
